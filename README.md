fruit-project

This is my CodeLouisville's Front end Web Development Project.

This project is responsive to different devices (small, medium and large), I used Foundation 6 and made several modification to the default values.

myStyle.css file is all of my CSS code.

code-app.js file is all of my JS code.

I took some text and picture from several website in the internet as Wikipedia (https://www.wikipedia.org/) to full fill my project.

There is one Top bar (Right  and Left ) hidden in small mode,
One Side bar (vertical menu) visible in small mode only,
There are Fruit, Juicers and Blenders links.

You can reveal a Form Modal making click in Login or Sign Up button,
inside of this Modal there are several validation code for text, password, email and password-confirmation.

You can reveal another Form Modal making click in "Pick a fruit ! " button,
inside of this Modal you can select  your prefer fruit and write your name.
All fruit name are inside an array,

You can reveal another Form Modal making click in "Subscribe ! " button,
It's only a notification text, you can close this Modal if you like.

Fruit and Juicers pictures are linked to Wikipedia.

The "You Deserve Fruit" panel is a tab-panel in large mode and it's an accordion in small and medium mode.


So, this is a partial end,

I's just only for a few minutes, I'll be back
